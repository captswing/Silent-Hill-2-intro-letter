        D. The Letter<br>
        - - - - - - - -<br>
        <br>
        Mary:<br>
        <br>
        In my restless dreams,<br>
        I see that town.<br>
        <br>
        Silent Hill.<br>
        <br>
        You promised you'd take me<br>
        there again someday.<br>
        But you never did.<br>
        <br>
        Well I'm alone there now...<br>
        <br>
        In our 'special place'<br>
        Waiting for you...<br>
        <br>
        Waiting for you to<br>
        come to see me.<br>
        <br>
        But you never do.<br>
        <br>
        And so I wait, wrapped in my<br>
        cocoon of pain and loneliness.<br>
        <br>
        I know I've done a terrible<br>
        thing to you.  Something you'll<br>
        never forgive me for.<br>
        <br>
        I wish I could change<br>
        that, but I can't.<br>
        <br>
        I feel so pathetic and ugly<br>
        laying here, waiting for you...<br>
        <br>
        Every day I stare up at the cracks<br>
        in the ceiling and all I can think<br>
        about is how unfair it all is...<br>
        <br>
        The doctor came today.<br>
        He told me I could go<br>
        home for a short stay.<br>
        <br>
        It's not that I'm getting better.<br>
        It's just that this may be<br>
        my last chance...<br>
        <br>
        I think you know what I mean...<br>
        <br>
        Even so, I'm glad to be coming<br>
        home.  I've missed you terribly.<br>
        <br>
        But I'm afraid James.<br>
        I'm afraid you don't really<br>
        want me to come home.<br>
        <br>
        Whenever you come see me,<br>
        I can tell how hard it is on you...<br>
        <br>
        I don't know if you<br>
        hate me or pity me...<br>
        Or maybe I just disgust you....<br>
        <br>
        I'm sorry about that.<br>
        <br>
        When I first learned that<br>
        I was going to die, I just<br>
        didn't want to accept it.<br>
        <br>
        I was so angry all the time and I<br>
        struck out at everyone I loved most.<br>
        Especially you, James.<br>
        <br>
        That's why I understand<br>
        if you do hate me.<br>
        <br>
        But I want you to<br>
        know this, James.<br>
        <br>
        I'll always love you.<br>
        <br>
        Even though our life together had<br>
        to end like this, I still wouldn't<br>
        trade it for the world.  We had<br>
        some wonderful years together.<br>
        <br>
        Well this letter has gone on<br>
        too long so I'll say goodbye.<br>
        <br>
        I told the nurse to give<br>
        this to you after I'm gone.<br>
        <br>
        That means that as you read this,<br>
        I'm already dead.<br>
        <br>
        I can't tell you to remember me,<br>
        but I can't bear for you to<br>
        forget me.<br>
        <br>
        These last few years since I<br>
        became ill...I'm so sorry for<br>
        what I did to you, did to us...<br>
        <br>
        You've given me so much and<br>
        I haven't bee able to return<br>
        a single thing.<br>
        <br>
        That's why I want you to live<br>
        for yourself now.<br>
        Do what's best for you, James.<br>
        <br>
        James...<br>
        <br>
        You made me happy.<br>
